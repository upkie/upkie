# Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute to the project. Here are some ideas:

- Build your own Upkie following the [build instructions](https://github.com/upkie/upkie/wiki)
- Develop a custom wrapper and train a new behavior by reinforcement learning
- Show your robot in [Show and tell](https://github.com/upkie/upkie/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)

Feel free to join the [chat](https://app.element.io/#/room/#upkie:matrix.org) to catch up with other Upkie makers.
