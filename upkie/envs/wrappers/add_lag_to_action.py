    """!
    Model lag by applying a low-pass filter to the action of an environment.

    Note that there is a difference between "delay" and "lag":

    - Delay is a fixed time interval corresponding to the time it takes the
      input to affect the output, e.g. `output(t + delay) = input(t)`.
    - Lag is a phase shift in the system's response. It can be thought of as a
      gradual response to input changes where the output does not immediately
      match the input, e.g. `d/dt{output}(t) = lag * (input(t) - output(t))`.

    In this wrapper, we model *lag* where the output (action forward to the
    wrapped environment) is a low-pass filtered version of the input (action
    passed to `step`).
