# Pitch: 2 is roughly the good damping value for a stiffness of 15; 1 is too
# low, resulting in oscillations of increasing magnitude; 3 is too high,
# resulting in permanent small oscillations as the robot rolls around.
#
# Position: 2.5 is roughly a good value to match the (2, 15) in pitch; 1.6 is
# also good on rough horizontal floor, 3.3 is too much and results in
# oscillations of increasing magnitude. Going for 1.6 now because 2.5 feels a
# bit more overshooty.
