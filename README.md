**Upkie** is an open source wheeled biped robot. It has wheels for balancing and legs to negotiate uneven terrains. Upkies are designed to be buildable using only tools and components ordered online, like mjbots actuators. You can develop in Python or C++, on Linux or macOS, then deploy your agent to the robot's Raspberry Pi. Here are some [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@upkie) of Upkies in action.

This repository contains all the materials needed to build and control an Upkie:

## Installation

### From conda-forge

```console
conda install -c conda-forge upkie
```

### From PyPI

```console
pip install upkie
```

## Getting started

Let's start a Bullet simulation spine:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upkie/upkie/refs/heads/main/docs/images/bullet-spine.png" height="100" align="right" />

```console
./start_simulation.sh
```

Click on the robot in the simulator window to apply external forces. Once the simulation spine is running, we can control the robot using one of its Gymnasium environments, for instance:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import numpy as np
import upkie.envs

upkie.envs.register()

with gym.make("UpkieGroundVelocity-v3", frequency=200.0) as env:
    observation, _ = env.reset()
    gain = np.array([10.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.1])
    for step in range(1_000_000):
        action = gain.dot(observation).reshape((1,))
        observation, reward, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(action)
        if terminated or truncated:
            observation, _ = env.reset()
```

The Python code is the same whether we run in simulation or on a real Upkie. Head over to the [examples](https://github.com/upkie/upkie/tree/main/examples) directory for more use cases.

## Gymnasium environments

Upkie has environments compatible with the [Gymnasium API](https://gymnasium.farama.org/), for instance:

- `UpkieGroundVelocity`: keep legs straight and balance with the wheels.
- `UpkieServos`: control joint servos directly (position, velocity, torque)
    - `UpkieServoPositions`: control joint positions.
    - `UpkieServoTorques`: control joint torques.

Check out the full [list of environments](https://upkie.github.io/upkie/environments.html) for details.

## Agents

Larger Upkie agents have their own repositories:

- [MPC balancer](https://github.com/upkie/mpc_balancer): balance in place using model predictive control.
- [Pink balancer](https://github.com/upkie/pink_balancer): a more advanced agent that can crouch and stand up while balancing.
- [PPO balancer](https://github.com/upkie/ppo_balancer): balance in place with a policy trained by reinforcement learning.
- [PID balancer](https://github.com/upkie/pid_balancer): legacy agent used to test new Upkies with minimal dependencies.

Head over to the [new\_agent](https://github.com/upkie/new_agent) template to create your own, and feel free to open a PR here to add your agent to the list.

## How can I participate?

Contributions are welcome to both the hardware and software of Upkies! If you are a developer/maker with some robotics experience looking to hack on open source, check out the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). On the software side, you can also report any bug you encounter in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/upkie/upkie/issues).
